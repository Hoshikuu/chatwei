# ChatWei

**ChatWei** is a personal chat application developed purely for fun and learning purposes. It is not intended for commercial use or critical communication. This project is a playground where I experiment with features related to messaging, encryption, and database interaction. Whether you're curious about how chat systems work or you're just exploring, you're welcome to check it out!

## 💬 About the Project

ChatWei allows users to create, manage, and send messages in real time. The entire communication flow is handled through an API that interfaces with a backend database to store and retrieve messages, user data, and session information.

This app is designed as a lightweight yet functional messaging tool, and although it’s not built for production-grade use, it showcases essential concepts in modern chat app development.

## 🔐 Encryption

For message encryption, ChatWei relies on the [CipWei](https://github.com/Hoshikuu/cipwei) encryption library, which provides a custom, lightweight encryption method. This helps secure the contents of each message during transmission and storage, adding a basic layer of privacy and data protection.

> Note: While CipWei provides a fun approach to encryption, it is not intended for high-security applications.

## 📦 Releases
